## How to run 1Hive Tokens locally

First make sure that you have node and yarn installed and working. You'll also need to have [Metamask](https://metamask.io) or some kind of web wallet enabled to sign transactions in the browser.

Git clone this repo.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/1Hive/token-manager-app.git
```

Navigate into the `token-manager-app` directory.

```sh
cd token-manager-app
```

Install npm dependencies.

```sh
yarn
```

Start a development version of the Hooked Token Manager with buidler

```sh
yarn start
```

A new tab should appear in your browser. Now, any change in the frontend code or smart contract will automatically be applied.

## How to deploy 1Hive Tokens to an organization

1Hive Tokens has been published to APM on Rinkeby and xDai at `hooked-token-manager.open.aragonpm.eth`.

It can be used as a regular Token Manager, but define an extra ROLE (`SET_HOOK_ROLE`), and two new functions (`registerHook(address)` and `revokeHook(uint256)`).
