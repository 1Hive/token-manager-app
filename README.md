## How to run 1Hive Tokens locally

First make sure that you have node, npm, and the Aragon CLI installed and working. Instructions on how to set that up can be found [here](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/cli-intro.html). You'll also need to have [Metamask](https://metamask.io) or some kind of web wallet enabled to sign transactions in the browser.

Git clone this repo.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/1Hive/token-manager-app.git
```

Navigate into the `token-manager-app` directory.

```sh
cd token-manager-app
```

Install npm dependencies.

```sh
npm i
```

Publish 1Hive Tokens to the AragonPM

```sh
npx aragon devchain
npm run apm:publish:major
```

You can see it published with this command:

```

## How to deploy 1Hive Tokens to an organization

1Hive Tokens has been published to APM on Rinkeby at `hooked-token-manager.open.aragonpm.eth`.

It can be used as a regular Token Manager, but define an extra ROLE (`SET_HOOK_ROLE`), and two new functions (`registerHook(address)` and `revokeHook(uint256)`).
